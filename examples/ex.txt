Лайза и Джим были женаты два года. Они все делали вместе и никогда не разлучались. Спустя некоторое время с Джимом начало что-то происходить: он становился все более раздражительным, пассивным, его настроение резко менялось, случались срывы. Во время индивидуальной консультации Лайза сказала мне: «С ним стало очень тяжело. Чего я только ни делала, чтобы подбодрить мужа, но все впустую.

“You will from time to time meet a patient who shares a disturbing tale of multiple mistakes in his previous treatment. He has been seen by several clinicians, and all failed him. The patient can lucidly describe how his therapists misunderstood him, but he has quickly perceived that you are different. You share the same feeling, are convinced that you understand him, and will be able to help.” At this point my teacher raised his voice as he said, “Do not even think of taking on this patient! Throw him out of the office! He is most likely a psychopath and you will not be able to help him.”

You build the best possible story from the information available to you, and if it is a good story, you believe it. Paradoxically, it is easier to construct a coherent story when you know little, when there are fewer pieces to fit into the puzzle.

Нам остаются только поцелуи, Мохнатые, как маленькие пчелы, Что умирают, вылетев из улья. Они шуршат в прозрачных дебрях ночи, Их родина - дремучий лес Тайгета, Их пища - время, медуница, мята. Возьми ж на радость дикий мой подарок, Невзрачное сухое ожерелье Из мертвых пчел, мед превративших в солнце.

Тварь, покуда жизнь хватает, Донести хребет должна, И невидимым играет Позвоночником волна. Словно нежный хрящ ребенка, Век младенческой земли. Снова в жертву, как ягненка, Темя жизни принесли. Чтобы вырвать век из плена, Чтобы новый мир начать, Узловатых дней колена Нужно флейтою связать. Это век волну колышет Человеческой тоской, И в траве гадюка дышит

Стихотворения (1908-1937) (Осип Мандельштам)
- Your Highlight Location 779-785 | Added on Sunday, November 06, 2011, 12:59 AM

За гремучую доблесть грядущих веков, За высокое племя людей Я лишился и чаши на пире отцов, И веселья, и чести своей. Мне на плечи кидается век-волкодав, Но не волк я по крови своей, Запихай меня лучше, как шапку, в рукав Жаркой шубы сибирских степей. Чтоб не видеть ни труса, ни хлипкой грязцы, Ни кровавых костей в колесе, Чтоб сияли всю ночь голубые песцы Мне в своей первобытной красе. Уведи меня в ночь, где течет Енисей, Где сосна до звезды достает, Потому что не волк я по крови своей И меня только равный убьет.

>Я нынче в паутине световой, Черноволосой, светло-русой. Народу нужен свет и воздух голубой, И нужен хлеб и снег Эльбруса. И не с кем посоветоваться мне, А сам найду его едва ли, Таких прозрачных плачущих камней Нет ни в Крыму, ни на Урале. Народу нужен стих таинственно-родной, Чтоб от него он вечно просыпался И льнянокудрою, каштановой волной Его звучаньем - умывался.

And these two, going to California; going to sit in the lobby of the Beverly-Wilshire Hotel and watch people they envy go by, to look at mountains—mountains, mind you, and great trees—he with his worried eyes and she thinking how the sun will dry her skin. Going to look at the Pacific Ocean, and I'll bet a hundred thousand dollars to nothing at all, he will say, "It isn't as big as I thought it would be." And she will envy plump young bodies on the beach. Going to California really to go home again. To say, "So-and-So was at the table next to us at the Trocadero. She's really a mess, but she does wear nice clothes." And he, "I talked to good sound businessmen out there. They don't see a chance till we get rid of that fellow in the White House." And, "I got it from a man in the know—she has syphilis, you know. She was in that Warner picture. Man said she's slept her way into pictures. Well, she got what she was looking for." But the worried eyes are never calm, and the pouting mouth is never glad. The big car cruising along at sixty.

Какое дело этой девушке было до степной грязи: я не хотел рассказывать ей все как есть, не хотел, чтобы она почувствовала, что нам пришлось пережить. Зачем ей эта грязь, кровь, серый горизонт, которые не выходят у меня из головы. Я боялся заразить ее переполнявшими меня страхом, болью, боялся, что она не захочет слушать.

Люди любят узнавать про войну, не испытывая при этом ни малейших неудобств. Они читают про Верден или Сталинград, расположившись в удобном кресле, вытянув ноги к камину и готовясь на следующий день вернуться к обычным занятиям. На самом же деле тебе повезло, если эти события не приходится описывать в письме родным, сидя в грязном окопе. О войне нужно читать, когда перед тобой стоят проблемы. И помнить, что никакие заботы мирного времени не стоят седых волос. Только идиот может волноваться из-за зарплаты. О войне нужно читать во время бессонницы, когда ты чертовски устал, или на рассвете, как пишу я о ней сейчас, после приступа астмы.

Всплакну по тебе так же, как плакал, когда умер мой младший брат Людовик. Но тебя подстрелят только тогда, когда ты сам нарвешься на пулю. Я содрогнулся. По лицу текли слезы.

Super-AIDS. Only one in a million people gets Super-AIDS. You develop a test for Super-AIDS that's 99 percent accurate. I mean, 99 percent of the time, it gives the correct result -- true if the subject is infected, and false if the subject is healthy. You give the test to a million people. One in a million people have Super-AIDS. One in a hundred people that you test will generate a "false positive" -- the test will say he has Super-AIDS even though he doesn't. That's what "99 percent accurate" means: one percent wrong. What's one percent of one million? 1,000,000/100 = 10,000 One in a million people has Super-AIDS. If you test a million random people, you'll probably only find one case of real Super-AIDS. But your test won't identify one person as having Super-AIDS. It will identify 10,000 people as having it.

He came to the door stark naked and it might have been the President knocking for all he cared. He received the world in the raw. “Sal!” he said with genuine awe. “I didn’t think you’d actually do it. You’ve finally come to me.” “Yep,” I said. “Everything fell apart in me. How are things with you?”

similar is true on Earth. Ultimately, I don’t determine whether I arrive at the desired professional destination. Too many variables are out of my control. There’s really just one thing I can control: my attitude during the journey, which is what keeps me feeling steady and stable, and what keeps me headed in the right direction. So I consciously monitor and correct, if necessary, because losing attitude would be far worse than not achieving my goal.

My kids are endlessly amused by what they see as my earnestness. For years now they have played a game they call “The Colonel Says,” which involves parroting sayings of mine that they find particularly hilarious. My son Evan’s personal favorite, which I barked at him from beneath the family car I was trying to fix: “No one ever accomplished anything great sitting down.” Recently, they’ve joked about creating a “Colonel Says” app that would spit out sayings appropriate to any situation. It’s a great idea, though I think you’d only need one: “Be ready. Work. Hard. Enjoy it!” It fits every situation.

Pavilion Lake in British Columbia. It’s a beautiful, clear freshwater lake, the bottom of which is studded with microbialites: rock structures of all different shapes and sizes that look a lot like coral. Microbialites were very common for about two billion years of Earth’s early history but are quite rare today. So the purpose of the Pavilion Lake Research Project is to try to figure out how they are forming in order to understand more about the origins of life on Earth. It’s kind of like exploring another planet, being down there at the bottom of the lake looking at these things, so the international research team decided it made sense to get astronauts involved. As a result, I got qualified as a DeepWorker pilot.

Others never quite seem to figure that out and, in true tortoise-and-hare fashion, find themselves in a place they never expected to be: the back of the pack. They don’t know how to push themselves to the point of discomfort and beyond. Typically, they also don’t recognize their own weaknesses and are therefore reluctant to accept responsibility when things don’t turn out well.

“Now you just dig them in front. They have worries, they’re counting the miles, they’re thinking about where to sleep tonight, how much money for gas, the weather, how they’ll get there—and all the time they’ll get there anyway, you see. But they need to worry and betray time with urgencies false and otherwise, purely anxious and whiny, their souls really won’t be at peace unless they can latch on to an established and proven worry and having once found it they assume facial expressions to fit and go with it, which is, you see, unhappiness, and all the time it all flies by them and they know it and that too worries them no end. Listen! Listen! ‘Well now,’ ”

She was dull. She spoke of evenings in the country making popcorn on the porch. Once this would have gladdened my heart but because her heart was not glad when she said it I knew there was nothing in it but the idea of what one should do. “And what else do you do for fun?” I tried to bring up boy friends and sex. Her great dark eyes surveyed me with emptiness and a kind of chagrin that reached back generations and generations in her blood from not having done what was crying to be done—whatever it was, and everybody knows what it was. “What do you want out of life?” I wanted to take her and wring it out of her. She didn’t have the slightest idea what she wanted. She mumbled of jobs, movies, going to her grandmother’s for the summer, wishing she could go to New York and visit the Roxy, what kind of outfit she would wear—something like the one she wore last Easter, white bonnet, roses, rose pumps, and lavender gabardine coat. “What do you do on Sunday afternoons?” I asked. She sat on her porch. The boys went by on bicycles and stopped to chat. She read the funny papers, she reclined on the hammock. “What do you do on a warm summer’s night?” She sat on the porch, she watched the cars in the road. She and her mother made popcorn. “What does your father do on a summer’s night?” He works, he has an all-night shift at the boiler factory, he’s spent his whole life supporting a woman and her outpoppings and no credit or adoration. “What does your brother do on a summer’s night?” He rides around on his bicycle, he hangs out in front of the soda fountain. “What is he aching to do? What are we all aching to do? What do we want?” She didn’t know. She yawned. She was sleepy. It was too much. Nobody could tell. Nobody would ever tell. It was all over. She was eighteen and most lovely, and lost.

If you enter a new environment intent on exploding out of the gate, you risk wreaking havoc instead. I learned this the hard way in graduate school, when we were in the lab designing low-pressure fuel pumps. We tracked our progress using different dyes, and at the end of the first day, we had an array of jars filled with leftover dye. I very efficiently took charge and poured them all down the drain in the corner of the room. Why bother asking questions? I already knew what needed to be done. Well, as it turned out, that particular drain was actually part of the lab’s data collection system and therefore had to be kept spotless. The professor who ran the place couldn’t believe I’d dumped dye all over it. Now the whole system had to be purged and purified, which meant a lot of extra work for him and other people. I’m sure that if he connected the dots today, he’d say, “That guy became an astronaut? But he’s an idiot!” When you have some skills but don’t fully understand your environment, there is no way you can be a plus one. At best, you can be a zero. But a zero isn’t a bad thing to be. You’re competent enough not to create problems or make more work for everyone else. And you have to be competent, and prove to others that you are, before you can be extraordinary. There are no shortcuts, unfortunately.

Loneliness, I think, has very little to do with location. It’s a state of mind. In the center of every big, bustling city are some of the loneliest people in the world. I’ve never felt that way in space. If anything, because our whole planet was on display just outside the window, I felt even more aware of and connected to the seven billion other people who call it

But fundamentally, life off Earth is in two important respects not at all unworldly: You can choose to focus on the surprises and pleasures, or the frustrations. And you can choose to appreciate the smallest scraps of experience, the everyday moments, or to value only the grandest, most stirring ones. Ultimately, the real question is whether you want to be happy. I didn’t need to leave the planet to find the right answer. But knowing what it was definitely helped me love life off Earth. My main source of frustration, in fact, was that I ever had to sleep. It just seemed like a waste of space, where there was so much more left to do and see and feel.
